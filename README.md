# Ear Trainer

### What's this?

A tool to help students of music develop their ability to hear intervals.

You start out with two pitches, the note for the lower one is given to you and
you must guess the higher note. After correctly guessing, you are given a new
pair of pitches, both of which are unknown. Guess the lower note first and then
the higher note correctly to proceed.

The goal is to develop your ability to hear intervals both horizontally and
vertically.

### Technology used
